# Research Review

## FF Planning System

* Winner of classical track of International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2000.
* Contains 2 parts: Relaxed GRAPHPLAN as heuristic estimator, and Enforced Hill-climbing as search strategy.

## FastDownward Planning System

* Winner of classical track of International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2004.
* It contains 3 phases: Translation, Knowledge compilation and search.
* The problem is translated into "multi-valued planning tasks" for better searching.
* In knowledge compilation phase, the critical information about the planning task is compiled into a number of data structures for efficient access.  Domain transition graphs, causal graph, successor generator and Axiom evaluator is built for searching phase.
* Several search algo can be choosed: Greedy best first search, Multi-heruistic best first search and Focused iterative-broadening search.

## LAMA Planner

* Winner of classical track of International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2008.
* Based on FastDownward Planning System
* Causal graph heurisic is replaced with new heurisic derived from landmarks.
* LAMA weighs the estimated cost-to-go (as a measure of plan quality) against the estimated goal distance (as a measure of remaining search effort) by combining the values for the two estimates.
* After finding an initial solution with a greedy best-first search, it conducts a series of weighted Aâˆ— searches with decreasing weights, restarting the search each time from the initial state when an improved solution is found.
