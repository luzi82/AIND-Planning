<h1>Research Review</h1>

<h2>FF Planning System</h2>

<ul>
<li>Winner of classical track of International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2000.</li>
<li>Contains 2 parts: Relaxed GRAPHPLAN as heuristic estimator, and Enforced Hill-climbing as search strategy.</li>

<h2>FastDownward Planning System</h2>

<ul>
<li>Winner of classical track of International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2004.</li>
<li>It contains 3 phases: Translation, Knowledge compilation and search.</li>
<li>The problem is translated into "multi-valued planning tasks" for better searching.</li>
<li>In knowledge compilation phase, the critical information about the planning task is compiled into a number of data structures for efficient access.  Domain transition graphs, causal graph, successor generator and Axiom evaluator is built for searching phase.</li>
<li>Several search algo can be choosed: Greedy best first search, Multi-heruistic best first search and Focused iterative-broadening search.</li>

<h2>LAMA Planner</h2>

<ul>
<li>Winner of classical track of International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2008.</li>
<li>Based on FastDownward Planning System</li>
<li>Causal graph heurisic is replaced with new heurisic derived from landmarks.</li>
<li>LAMA weighs the estimated cost-to-go (as a measure of plan quality) against the estimated goal distance (as a measure of remaining search effort) by combining the values for the two estimates.</li>
<li>After finding an initial solution with a greedy best-first search, it conducts a series of weighted Aâˆ— searches with decreasing weights, restarting the search each time from the initial state when an improved solution is found.</li>
